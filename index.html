        Hello, I am Will, better known on the internet as Creeperwillie, to better demonstrate topics in my most recent and elaborate world building project, Aral Uyi, I have created this website as a wiki for potential fans to look at, on the top of the page there are frequent pages, such as About The Project and the FAQ, This site will no doubt expand and become integrated with new techniques as my coding abilities improve, because I am too cheap to have a subscription to website buidling programs. Hopefully by the end, it looks nice, functional, and ready for future visitors
