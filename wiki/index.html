    <h2 id="info-header">Not so Brief History of Aral Uyi</h2>
     

      <span class="intext-heading">Geography:</span> Aral Uyi is in the northern hemisphere, around 45• north near a major warm water current to the southern portion of the island that allows for a Mediterranean climate to establish itself there, allowing for increased agricultural output and overall a more sedentary lifestyle than the extreme north.
      <br>
     <h3>Part 1a: Pre Oñtüstik History</h3>
<h4>
<br>
The first people groups are believed to have sailed over from nearby islands in search of food and land. These various people groups established themselves in the larger portions of the island, specifically the Frida Peninsula, 5 river valleys and the area of the eastern Soltuskki Qaray today occupied by the Quaterli. These states developed agriculture and depending on the region developed different cultures with different beliefs and viewpoints. The important aspect to note is the fact that these groups sparsely settled the Southern portion of the island which would later be settled by different people groups due to the vastly different climates present there. 
<br>
The various people groups could be classified by their location and shared culture, and eventually where large cities developed.
<br>
<table>
  <tr><td>Five River Valleys</td>	<td>The Five River valleys was the center of the indigenous world, primarily due to the wetlands near the deltas that allow for irrigation of common crops such as rice that requires such climate to survive. The culture here was fragmented between large states vying for power with local tribal elites. This caused a lack of unity allowing for future groups to easily take the region</td></tr>
  <tr><td>North Eastern</td><td>	The area currently occupied by the Quaterli, which will be referred to as the North Eastern Indigenous Group, what occupier by several tribes that were hostile to outsiders and were generally isolated. This allowed for the later Battle of Parrak. Parrak is a costal field which received it’s name later on in history due to it prolonging North Eastern independence for another 60 years.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Eastern</td><td>	The Eastern Indigenous people’s known as Native Tomanders as opposed to New Tomanders, are a multitude of various different culture groups vying for power. For the purposes of this text we are only going to be focusing on the important ones. The Vrana clan was a group in the South East Tomen states, they would later be incorporated into the primary Tomanic culture with the rise of the Ulkenirek. The Orol clan in the middle of the Tomanic states was a powerful state that controlled most maritime trade routes, especially those to Halestre and Vinecia, where crucial textiles and spices were produced. The Falkegh clan could be considered a mix of North Eastern Indigenous people’s and a Tomanic Group, these people are notable for their reputation as fierce warriors and their cult of weaponry, which had it that a person’s weapon was an extension of their soul, and to not have a weapon is to lose one’s soul.</td></tr>
    <td>Fridan</td><td>	The Fridan people were the least changed by the new migrations, with very little Üyi colonists entering, this allowed for special autonomy and a strong independent sentiment to develop among their people, due to this. They would get the reputation for ending the Ädilian empire with their reliance and focus on terrain and their horsemanship. </td></tr>
</table>
Part 1b: The “Käri” people
      <br>
At 1 AV an organized colony of Vicio people to the south arrived in what would a  a now be called Vinecia. The majority were entrepreneurs, who quickly established themselves trading with the various Tomanic and Five Rivers clans, most notably the Orol clan. 
<br>
Vinecian Exploration:
<br>
Vinecian merchants soon established on the Beti River a temporary settlement known today as Ketema, a merchant city with a vibrant and expansive marketplace, with thousands of vendors and buyers arriving daily at it’s peak. 
<br>
Vinecian Hardships
<br>
Ketema also had a keep with strong stone bricks and various ballista emplacements for usage against enemy siege engines. 
After the Vinecian navy had helped their Orol allies against the Falkengh navy, which was underdeveloped and small. The Falkengh not willing to earn a bad reputation, marched to Ketema along with the principal enemy of Vinecia, the Halestren people to the west, who were outcompeted economically by Vinecian ships. The defensive preparations of the city was tested in the first siege of Ketema (326 AV) with Halestren foot soldiers and siege engines attempting to storm the keep. Halestren and Falkengh troops stormed the first set of the walls, with a 3-1 numbers advantage on their side, modern historians believe that a small skirmish between the Falkengh and Halestren troops began as a result of a small argument of which homeland was greater, this led to a stray arrow going into the head of the Emir, reportedly going straight through his skull. As a result to, the coalition fragmented and soon destroyed each other, ironically with the Halestren forces using the Keteman first wall as their defensive line. As a result of this battle, the Falkengh lost their prominence and influence over the Toman states, culminating in their conquest in 1343 AV by Oñu forces. 
<br>
<span class="intext-heading">The New Tomanic States:<span>
Around 940 AV various peoples under the general designation of the autsajder people by native tomanders began migrating in the thousands to various urban centers. Mostly these people were outcasts and exiled persons from their homelands, these created a diverse group who mixed together, shared power, and eventually came to overthrow most of the clans of the Tomanic States. These states introduced a new religion which proved central to structure and power in the region. 
<br>
During this time a strong animistic belief system called Firasci was practiced and helped legitimize rule for Tomen Dukes and Counts, allowing them to receive power from their people and the support of the nobility. 
<br>
Most of the older tribes were wiped out, leaving the Orol and Vrana clans ousted from their hegemonic influence over the smaller clans and tribes. They were replaced by major duchies, grand duchies and counties. Notably the Više dynasty will take hold in the southern Toman states and the hjältar dynasty in the center with the old Falkengh chieftains struggling for control in the north. 
<br>
  </h4>
<h3>Part 1c; State Building in Early post Oñtüstik Aral Uyi</h3>
  <h4>
Around 1234 AV organized expeditions by the northern Üyi people began arriving to Aral Üyi. These people came from a centralized region with a strong kingly figure and subservient nobility and clergy. Their colony that they establish, the Oñutüstik principality, or Oñu for short, 
With time the Oñtüstik principality became a powerful empire with few rivalries in the history of the island. They pioneered in government and triumphed in their rule over the lands they governed. The impact still can be seen in most nations of the Soltuskki Qaray who wish to preserve the glory and culture of the Üyi past.
<br>
The Oñu served as a centralizing force in the north, with Oñu roads being used in the north for the next 2000 years, along with the asïl system of government, in which local leaders would submit to regional leaders who submit to the emperor. This allowed for enough autonomy to properly administer local regions while continuing rapid expansion into new territories.
    <br>
These advancements differed to those developed by the Vinecian culture to the south. They established different values and a sense of morality compared with the northern Oñu state. The Vinecians ruled with decentralized rule and a merit based society, this difference would lead to the outbreak of the Vinecian war for Independence against Oñu domination and the first Vinecian golden age.

<h3>Part 2: Cultural Golden Age during Vinecian hegemony</h3>
  <h4>
Oñtüstik leaders were expansionistic and arrogant and by 1600 AV and where eager to expand their overextended empire into the populated Toman Clans and Vinecia. As Vinecia had a strong economic value, and was already launching raids into Oñutisik territory into their satellites in Halestre and Novo Uyiska, military leaders decided to raze Vinecian farmland and cities. This led to the Vinecian military fighting the large Oñtüstik raiding party at the capital of Vinecia. In the decisive battle for Ketema, the ancient capital of Vinecia, the hero of Vinecian culture, Vojskovođa, the duke of Ulkenirek formed an alliance between himself and the Vinecians. This was a defensive alliance,  to preserve the desert Ulkenirek from their neighboring Tomanic States of the Više dynasty. His troops which served with extreme competency and valor were also a reflection of his tactical genius. In a planned ambush, the over confident Oñu troops found themselves trapped and were slaughtered by the thousands by Vinecian regulars and cavalry and Ulkenirek regulars. This would be known if the Qarayian world as the battle of the 5 battalions, due to their glorification of the ambush as a sign of unity among the Üyi people, and became a sign of revisionist martyrdom. However this sentiment was not felt by the regional leaders in the Oñu government, who began to raise their own armies against the Oñutisik domination. This eventually led to multiple different independence movements and a civil war. The war was finalized when most of the land in the Halestre and Novo Uyiska Duchies were annexed into the Vinecian sovereignty. This victory cemented Vinecia as a major power of Aral Üyi. With this development Vojskovođa convinced the Vinecian rulers to help him with much needed resources in controlling the Tomen States. As part of the alliance Vinecian troops began entering into Toman affairs and by the golden age of Vinecia the Duchy of Ulkenirek, who’s dukes swore fielty to the Vinecian Kings, had united the Duchies and counties of the Tomanic states. Due to the new land and increased trade, many believe that this prompted the golden age of Vinecian culture and science.

Part 3: Social, Religious and Technological Advancement during Classical Vinecia
  
Part 4 Fall of Vinecia and the decentralization of power:
  </h3>
<h4>In 2062 Vinecian forces were at war with the Ädilian confederation of Özen Añgari. This confederation has already embraced gunpowder weapons, to great effect against Oñutisik cavalry and pikemen. Vinecia, hoping for a quick victory recklessly crossed the Arco river into Özen territory. This reckless maneuver proved to be born out of arrogance when Özen cavalry stormed the Fords of the Arco to devastating effect. As a result many smaller groups began to revolt against the central Vinecian government and the state descended into civil war. In addition, with the Oñutisik Empire fragmenting, the following era would be called fragmented world, as political centralization rapidly decreased, due to the constant fighting between rival fiefdoms and counties.
<br>
  <img src="" alt="">
World circa 2100
To properly look at the world, one must take a regional look upon different geographic locations. Thus, it will be organized in a chart between the states of the former Oñutisik Empire in the Soltusikke Qaray, the Fridan peninsula, Vinecia, Halestre, Özen Añgari, Novo Uyiska, Više, Falkengh, and Ulkenirek states.
  <br>
  <table>
    <tr><td>Soltusikke Qaray</td><td>	With the collapsing Oñutisik Kingdom, various isolated areas gained special privilege keep them in the Empire. These territories usually were devoid of soil suitable for agriculture, creating for most a pastoral life. These tribes gained enough autonomy, especially after the Fall of Patreli from Vinecian forces, they no longer took input from Oñutisik kings, this creates various different tribes with a similar heritage occupying a similar space. This led to conflict, especially over migration paths across the tundras and the taigas. This was focused in the Muzdatılğan Özen province where limited agriculture was possible for parts of the year. This was where the tribal confederation of the Solitus Birriken, who would launch raids into various other territories across the Northern plains. This Empire would be fragmented by their lack of firearms and their poor soil, creating a small population compared to their neighbors of Ädil and the Quaterli. They would end up in conflict with the Özen Añgari and Voluski tribes seeking control over these regions. </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Fridan</td><td>	The Fridan people of the Fridan peninsula were the closest to the indigenous inhabitants of the region, however Qarayian elites still held sway despite their populace’s disatisfaction. The Qarayian officials frequently conscripted Fridan natives into their ranks. Eventually the Voluski clan would take control, and would help combat the Özen Añgari in defense of their trade partners in Bulaski.<td></tr>
    <tr><td>Vinecia</td><td>	Vinecia after the disaster at the Arco River began to fragment, especially in the Tomanic possessions, Novo Uyiska and Halestre, causing massive civil strife. In addition, various pretenders to the throne arrived, most notably the Pretender King Mortri, who was the bastard son of the current king. At the battle of Dunvil, Motri’s forces were destroyed by the Vinecian eagle guard, and eventually the Vinecian realm would be reunited. After the unification of Vinecia, they moved to reestablish control over the previously Vinecian territories. This resulted in supported a pro-Vinecian coup in Novo Uyiska. This of the and the expulsion of Qarayian people’s from the region. After the conquest of Novo Uyiska, Vinecia looked to conquer the new Toman state of Luminare. This state had developed a synthetic culture between Vinecia and southern Tomanics. This prompted four conflicts with Luminare, seeking their subjugation. The conflict started during the Vinecian civil war, where loyalist troops were deployed in Tomanic possessions, specially in the cities of Velikiste and Floksem on the banks of and Frilie respectively. The governor of the Tomanic territories , in 2065 AV declared the independence of a new southern Tomanic state, Luminare. Specifics about their culture, and art can be seen in their part of the table. Luminaran soldiers attacked the various garrisons at Velikiste and Floksem taking them into the new state of Luminare, allowing for an increased population to create an army. One can attribute the rise of the Luminare to a series of different factors, including weakness after the Arco and during the Vinecian civil war.  After this, a ceasefire was arranged that would cause a tense peace between the two for the next 13 years (2068 AV) when the civil war had concluded. The Vinecian army, still exhausted and divided due to the civil war, had little chance against the Luminaran offensive (2081 AV), however at Ketema and Aure the Luminaran forces, along with the Luminaran Crescent guard, were defeated by determined resistance. In Aure, the Vinecian Eagle Guard destroyed most of the Crescent guard, who acted as a rearguard to the invading force. At Ketema, the Luminaran army advanced directly into Vinecian defenses and cannon fire, this resulted in thousands of casualties in the vale of Ketema. This caused peace negotiations to begin, as the Vinecian civil wars resumed for another 12 years, as another pretender, prince Falum revolted against his father. In the third, and largest war, Luminaran troops overran the border, defeating the prince Falum’s army, which had previously deserted in mass to rightful King Iluste forces. The Luminaran crescent guard, was unexpectedly shattered during this battle at Laktus, showed to the Vinecians that the crescent guard had become a weak elite unit who’s elimination would negatively impact morale. In the fields outside Aure the Vinecian First Imperial Army fought the Luminaran liberation forces. This would result in he Battle of the Aurelen Valley, in which Luminaran troops were slaughtered by reckless frontal assaults. Despite this, Luminaran troops were able to retreat mostly intact, and were able to fight a desperate, determined retreat. This led to peace being signed as Vinecian troops began marching over the border. The final Vinecian-Luminaran war ended after the battle of  Velikiste that resulted in the annexation of Luminare in 2110 AV. </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Halestre</td><td>	Halestre once again achieved independence under their Grand Emperor Heothronen, formerly Governor of Halestre in 2078 AV. Due to the aforementioned civil war, and conflicts with the Luminare, they were able to swiftly leave the Vinecian sphere. The path for retaining Halestren independence was a dark and difficult civil war, lasting for nearly 20 years with the Grand Emir Aljadid against the pretender Eaozid Vahid. During this time various powers competed for influence over Halestre, and it’s valuable iron and copper mines. The Halestren civil war started with the battle of Ft. Vojskoda (In 2158 AV) in which the Eovid Kahid took control of the vital fortification on the Özen border. This allowed for Özen zealots to enter Halestre. Özen raiders were triumphant against the disorganized Halestren armies at the battles of Teñiz Porte (2163 AV) and the battle for Antara (2176 AV). These raids both discredited Eovid, for collaborating with an enemy of Halestre, and showed the inability of the government to stop such raids. During this time, the Halestren imperial guard was reformed, and modernized to be able to properly compete in modern combat. Despite the captures of Teniz Porte and Antara, Eovid still lost the Battle of Kritma (2180 AV) with sever casualties on both sides. This army was defeated by Özen forces at the Second Battle of Antara. Antara is an important city, as it controls the dikes for Horthenran’s water supply, creating a siege of the city possible. During this time, Vinecian officials, weary of the Özen forces so close to Vinecian borders readily feared an invasion of Vinecia. These fears came to fruition with the raid on Aure (2182 AV). This prompted for the Vinecian army to get involved in the situation in Halestre on the side of the Emir Alajdid. In the third battle of Antara (2185 AV) Vinecian units, specifically aforementioned Eagle’s Guard, an elite formation of professional drilled soldiers with eagle’s feather’s in their helmets. In Battle for Horthenran (2187 AV) Özen forces destroyed by the Halestren imperial guard, with most of the city, including it’s vast palaces and marketplaces being burned and desecrated. The Vinecian Eagle’s Guard, along with the rest of the 2nd army fought in brutal hand to hand combat with Özen zealots and army units. In the first defeat in 120 years, Özen forces were slaughtered by the thousands by the Vinecian army. In the final treaty the Vinecians would maintain the sovereignty of the Halestren government and to protect their people.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Özen Añgari </td><td>	The confederation of Özen Añgari was a major developing power who’s victory at the Arco promoted new militaristic thoughts and tendencies. This action was punctuated with the revolt of the native Deutchnvidiem people, that stimulated rapid militarism and Ädilian nationalism. This desire to gain the glory of Üyi back after the disasters of the previous Oñutisik government at Ketema and the fall of Patreli. After the Arco, Patreli and Ädilia were taken by the Özen force, however they were stopped by the native Uz Dienvidiem Government, at the Battle of Ädilia, and subsequently lost the important city. This prompted future Özen Crusades against the Uz Dienvidiem, with the end result being at the Battle of Patreli, where the Uzen force was destroyed. At this time, the atrocities of the occupation, including the near eradication of the Uzen people. Özen forces soon established autocratic control over the previous Uzen lands. During this time, the Özen belief in crusades against those who destroy and are against Üyi culture, created the Özen zealots, which formed the core of the Özen cavalry, that lived in the old, ancient, ways of their Üyi ancestors. These fanatical regiments led an invasion of Halestre after the defeat of Ft. Vojskoda, however their hate for the Vinecian people led to the disastrous raid on Aure, which caused the mobilization of Vinecian troops. After the battle of Horthereran, Özen forces where occupied with suppressing revolts, especially in the Bulaski region. Eventually, the King Qoldawşı Karalis reformed the tribal council into a modern state, renamed the state to Ädil, and disbanded the zealots.</td>
    <tr><td>Novo Uyiska</td><td>	Novo Uyiska’s fate lay uncertain, and many different governments and coalitoions in Novo Uyiska were overthrown by different ethnic groups in the 10 years of terror from 2087-2098 AV. Eventually the Uyiskan element and the Halestren and Vinecian element settled on an elective monarchy, in which each region would be placed under one of two kings, who were to submit to a Minister of Affairs, who was deposed after 8 years. Novo Uyiskan forces were varied in appearance based off of their origin, and especially after the conquest of the southern Halestren states, Novo Uyiska was one of the few states to successfully deal with the ethnic tension in their lands. Novo Uyiska was attacked in 2101 AV and  in 2151 AV annexed by a pro-Vinecian coup.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Luninare </td><td>	Luminare was a new Tomanic state that had it’s origins in the Vinecian expansion into the Tomanic region starting in 1542 AV with the relocation of the Više and Ulkenirek clans, this caused Tomanic people to gradually assimilate into the new Vinecian empire, which led to the Governate of Eastern Vinecia to be established to prevent revolution and keep civil order between the different ethnic groups. This worked until 2062 AV when the Eastern born governor, began raising an army, and in 2065 AV, Governor Cillo Triane revolted against the Vinecian crown, seeking the independence for his Luminaran clan. Luminaran culture, as defined by the Luminaran Declaration of Independence as a new culture that is distinct, yet influenced by Vinecian culture and beliefs, and the native Tomanic culture and belief. In their 46 year reign, they built the temple of the crescent in  Velikiste and improved the roads and infrastructure, creating Velikiste from a secondary city to a principal city in Vinecia and a jewel among Tomanic cities. Luminaran wars of conquest over Vinecia, also known as the Vinecian-Luminaran wars are covered in the Vinecian section, in this section, the Luminaran-Ulkenirek and Luminaran-Više wars will be discussed in the Više section. The Luminaran-Ulkenirek war, could be divided into 3 different phases, the Ulken offensive, stalemate, and Luminaran offensive. In 2067 AV, Luminaran troops were assaulted by Ulkenirek national troops across the border, seeking to unite all Tomanic people’s. In the first battle of Field of Petrolilith Luminaran troops were deployed across the Frilie river, hoping to oppose any crossings, however after a long day of marching, the troops were exhausted and proved incapable of resisting the Ulken advance, and the Luminaran line was broken. This would provoke the conflict, already spanning into it’s second year, into a protracted stalemate, with the siege of  Velikiste tying up both Ulken and Luminaran relief forces in the region. This would eventually cause the palace of crescents to be constructed in memory of the siege. Eventually in the battle of Flotsdam Luminaran forces overwhelmed the depleted and starving Ulken army, causing a Ulken withdrawal to the border. A ceasefire and treaty was signed in 2078 AV that seceded various regions of Ulkenirek to Luminaran control. This would lead the Ulken state to collapse, and redivide into ethnic and feudalistic conflicts. This creates the redivision of the Tomanic people’s. Later, these conflicts would span with the new Više government. </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Više</td><td>	Više declared independence from Ulkenirek </td>
    <tr><td>Falkengh</td><td>	Falkengh already was in an autonomous position due to their disdain for central authority, which caused them to revolt against Ulken forces in 2071 AV, which they soon achieved after Ulken authority disintegrated with the independence of Hjältar and Više. They renewed the policy of expansion in the Neo-Crusader movement which is a jingoistic realignment of society back to the older values, such as a reintroduction of Filasci, a modified version of the Firasci belief that introduces Falkengh values of honor, weapons, and glory. The Falkengh tribes frequently combated the Hjältar and later the Quaterli for control of the region.</td>
    <tr><td>Hjältar </td><td>Coming soon!</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Uz Dienvidiem</td><td>	The Kingdom, or Government of Uz Dienvidiem, was a tribal confederation in the southern Ädilian plains, they promoted native Uzen culture, however they did not actively repress Üyilian culture. Uzen culture, despite the similarities in name, are not similar in mannerism, with a distinct architectural style and distinct language and poetry. One of the most common forms of poetry, especially in Ädilia and Patreli was the garš īss garši, which involves 7 long lines, followed by 14 short lines, followers by 7 long lines for a total of 28 lines. This style of poetry would be used extensively and exclusively by the Ädilian government as a promotion of what it means to be Ädilian, and a descent of Üyi culture. The various conflicts between the Uzen and Özen forces could be seen in detail in the Özen Añgari section. Currently, in Patreli, the Uzen section is still one of the largest sections of the ancient city, which extensive usage of the Uzen arc and doorway in most buildings, including the Quaterlian Palace of Snow in the city.<td><tr>
      <tr><td>Quaterli</td><td>	During this time, the limited population in North East Üyistan declared their independence from central authority. For the most part, the Quaterli during this time battled in the snow against the Falkengh skirmishers and Solitus invaders. The primary war would be that against the Solitus’s attempt to annex Quaterli, in the Battle of the Parrak Plains, the Solitus forces were destroyed by Quaterli cavalry and musketry, which caused immense shock in the Solitus military. This is suspected to be where the inspiration for the Quaterli poem, Qaramud Pashpane, which rallies the nation to join their sons on the battlefield. </td>

Served with extreme valor against rebellions and Luminare, Novo Uyiska, and interceded decisively in the Halestren civil war. Fought against Crescent, rogue Imperial Guard and Özen zealots.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Özen Zealots</td>	<td>Özen Añgari</td> 	<td>Qulsinis</td><td> Özen	Fanaticism and sense of superiority over non-Üyi people. Major political factor and faction. Intervened in Halestre along with the regular army and raided Aure. They rarely had standardized uniforms, however common attributes were large cavalry detachments, with the curved scimitars and short swords of Oñutisik style. They also had banners fixed on the commanding officers pack, creating a sense of Üyi unity and pride. They also frequently had the letters for Üyi or Oñu on their shields and helmets, Oñu- ㅠ and Uyi - и.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Imperial Guard</td>	<td>Halestre</td>	<td>Alharas Tebrik</td><td>	Large 4 point stars on their shield and on a point of their helmets/hats. They also have distinct yellow shields as well. They were distinct and trained better and apart from the regular ranks. They fought valiantly against Özen zealots and rebels in the Halestren civil war and aided the Vinecian counter attack.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Crescent Guard</td>	<td>Luminare</td>	<td>Polmesec Stražer</td> 	<td>Polmesec Stražer was one of the key elements of the new Luminaran army, with distinctive Sideways crescents on their helmets and shoulder pads. This unit underperformed compared to their Vinecian counterpart, and were poorly trained for special units. They frequently were placed into suicidal positions and were plagued by bad commanders, their failure to hold the line was shown to the world at the battle of Laktus (See Vinecian section above) this led to their disuse and eventual disbandment in 2108 two years before their annexation.</td></tr>

Generally changes in Özen politics created a modern state in the tribal federation, and created the Ädilian kingdom, Ädil was a new word meaning righteous in the Özen language. They seemed to embrace the syncretic culture by ending the repression of native peoples and fully integrating Vidriem, a “reservation” for native Ädilians. This created a new Golden Age in Ädilian history, prompting the increase in art. This is primarily seen with the increase of the garš īss garši format, believing it to be a sense of Ädilian pride and distinction from other Üyi people. While the Ädilian government separated itself from the belief that they would be the next Üyistan, believing that the old times would never come, however several key leaders increased Ädil’s size and influence to become the dominant power. 

The ruler Qısta Twılğan Karalis, now looks on to a prosperous reign, hoping to expand his new kingdom
